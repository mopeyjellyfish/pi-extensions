# pi-status-line

`@mopeyjellyfish/pi-status-line` replaces Pi's footer with a focused,
Powerlevel10k-style status line. It uses the same thin inline segment grammar,
Nerd Font v3 icons, and semantic palette as `pi-powerline-footer`.

## Install

Remove `pi-powerline-footer` before installing this package. Pi supports one
custom footer at a time, so two footer extensions are last-writer-wins rather
than composable.

```sh
pi remove npm:pi-powerline-footer
pi install npm:@mopeyjellyfish/pi-status-line
```

A terminal using a Nerd Font v3 font is required for the `` separator and
segment icons.

For development from this repository, load only this package:

```sh
npm exec -- pi \
  --no-extensions \
  --no-skills \
  --no-prompt-templates \
  --no-themes \
  -e packages/status-line
```

## Layout

Segments appear in this order:

1. model;
2. thinking effort;
3. project directory;
4. effective Git or routed-worktree branch;
5. context use and auto-compaction indicator;
6. cumulative session tokens;
7. todo progress and the active item, or the next pending item.

For example:

```text
 GPT-5.6 Sol  think:high   pi-extensions   main   72.5%/372k 󰁨    28M   2/5 · Implement integration
```

Unrelated extension statuses follow the first-party segments. The renderer
drops optional segments and shortens long values to remain within the terminal
width.

This package replaces only the footer/status function of
`pi-powerline-footer`. It intentionally does not reproduce that package's
custom editor, welcome overlay, stash, bash mode, prompt history, or working
vibes.

## First-party integrations

The package consumes two optional, versioned Pi event-bus channels:

- `mopeyjellyfish:pi-worktrunk:route:v1` supplies the routed worktree path and
  branch. The project-directory segment remains stable while Git status and the
  branch segment follow the active worktree instead of showing `main` or a
  duplicate Worktrunk status.
- `mopeyjellyfish:pi-todo:summary:v1` supplies closed/total progress and the
  active or next item title. It renders as
  ` 2/5 · Implement status integration`.

Both producer packages remain independently useful without this package. They
retain their standard `setStatus()` fallback, and `pi-todo` retains its bounded
widget. The status line filters those fallback keys only while the matching
structured integration state is present. All unrelated extension statuses are
preserved.

## Styling

The first release deliberately has one opinionated style rather than a theme
configuration surface. It follows `pi-powerline-footer` defaults: mauve model,
thinking-level colours, teal directory, semantic Git state, threshold-aware
context, muted tokens, and a dim `` separator. Todo uses warning colour while
work remains and success colour when all items are closed.
